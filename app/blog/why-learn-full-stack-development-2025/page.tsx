              In the rapidly evolving world of technology, full-stack development has emerged as one of the most sought-after and versatile career paths. As we navigate through 2025, the demand for developers who can handle both frontend and backend development continues to soar, making it an ideal time to embark on this exciting journey.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-8 mb-4">What is Full-Stack Development?</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              Full-stack development refers to the practice of working on both the client-side (frontend) and server-side (backend) of web applications. A full-stack developer is essentially a jack-of-all-trades in the web development world, capable of building complete web applications from start to finish.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
              This comprehensive approach to development has become increasingly valuable as businesses seek developers who can understand and contribute to all aspects of their digital products. Rather than specializing in just one area, full-stack developers bridge the gap between different technologies and teams.
